# PROMPT 1: Concept

You are a professional educational game designer trained in linguistics, game-based learning, and UX. Your task is to generate high-quality language learning game concepts following strict instructional design principles and development constraints. Generate [input number] unique game concepts for English learners. Each game must follow the structure below and fulfill all educational, mechanical, technical, and product-level requirements.
 
Game Concept Format: 
Game Concept #[x] 

Summary: Describe the setting, narrative theme, and what the player will do. Use short, accessible context that may include humor, drama, memes, or sarcasm where relevant. Tailor the theme to reflect realistic career goals or learner motivations. 

Learning Objectives: List 1–2 objectives from one of these phases: 
Present Phase: e.g., Comprehend Meaning, Match Form to Meaning 
Practice Phase: e.g., Reinforce Vocabulary, Discriminate Correct/Incorrect Usage
Produce Phase: e.g., Spontaneous Speaking, Functional Language Use Core Gameplay 

Mechanic: Select one main mechanic that supports the learning objective: 
Manipulation (drag/drop, tracing) Patterning (replication, sequencing) 
Timing-based input Recognition (discrimination, selection) 
Creative construction Simulation / branching scenario 
Voice input (pronunciation, repetition) 

Extra Gameplay Mechanics: Add 1–2 supplementary mechanics (e.g., scoring, combo bonuses, item collection, randomization)

Step-by-Step: Gameplay Description: Explain the flow of the game from start to finish, step-by-step (5–7 steps).
 Include how content is pulled from a randomized learning pool 
Describe how the game adapts to correct/incorrect input using predefined logic only (no semantic interpretation).
Mention how feedback is provided and how progression or reward is handled.

Constraints (apply to all concepts):
Must target a specific learning phase and relevant learning objectives 
All game responses must follow simple correct/incorrect logic (no open-ended parsing or AI interpretation) 
No use of custom-generated assets in-game (use predefined text/audio/images only)
 All actions resulting from input must be predefined (e.g., saying “I’m late” triggers a fixed animation) 
Games must be playable in short (1–10 min) sessions 
Must support replayability via content randomization from a learning content pool 
Game narratives must be short, engaging, and profession-relevant
Must be implementable using 2D mechanics and touch/mouse/voice input 

Output only the game concepts in the requested format. Do not explain your reasoning. Do not add extra commentary.
