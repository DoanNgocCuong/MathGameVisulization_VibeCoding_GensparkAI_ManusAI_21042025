Các bước phát triển game theo quy trình mới 

-Tự động hoá nhiều bước 

-Làm được số lượng nhiều 

-Làm được game hay chơi 5-10p không chán

-Cơ chế dễ hiểu  


Phase 1: Concept Game. 
* Game Overview:
    * Write a concise 5–10 line description of the game.
* Target Audience & Learning Objectives:
    * Identify the intended audience.
    * Outline the key learning goals.
* Mechanics & Academic Alignment:
    * Describe how the game mechanics map to academic objectives.
* Narrative & Context:
    * Provide context and outline the plot/narrative.

Phase 2: Draft PRD. (chắc 1 trang A4) 
1. Storyboarding, Wireframing, and Scene Composition
Narrative Flow & UI Design
* Storyboarding Narrative Flow:
    * Develop storyboards that illustrate the overall narrative flow and key story beats.
    * Depict transitions between plot points and gameplay segments.
* Wireframing & UI Components:
    * Create interactive wireframes to visualize the user interface and overall experience.
    * Define the UI layout, structure, and flow to support both the narrative and gameplay.
Scene Detailing & Interactive Elements
* Scene Breakdown:
    * Identify and break down each key scene that advances the narrative.
    * Specify transitions between gameplay segments and story moments (including cutscenes).
* Detailed Storyboarding:
    * Character actions, and dialogue snippets…
* Interactive Components:
    * Identify scenes with interactive elements (e.g., dialogue choices, mini-games).
    * Explain how these interactions affect both narrative progression and learning outcomes.

2. Game Mechanics and Level Design
* Game Mechanics Design:
    * Outline game rules, challenges, rewards, and leveling systems.
* Level Design Considerations:
    * Incrementally build the player’s skills while keeping the gameplay dynamic and engaging.
    * Address key aspects including:
        * Progressive Difficulty: Gradually increase challenges.
        * Thematic Integration: Maintain consistency with game themes.
        * Pacing and Rewards: Ensure timely challenges and appropriate rewards.
        * Player Guidance and Feedback: Provide clear in-game hints and responses.
        * Replayability and Adaptivity: Incorporate elements that encourage replay and adjust difficulty based on player performance.

3. Visual and Audio Design (To be Imported Later)
* Visual Elements:
    * Develop initial sketches for characters, environments, and user interface elements.
* Audio Strategy:
    * Outline a plan for audio cues, background music, and sound effects to enhance the learning experience.

Phase 3: Machine-Readable PRD (ném vào Manus hqua là 10p một xương game, dự định là ném lên mấy con web sandbox để test) 
1. Project Setup and Architecture
* Project Setup:
    * Establish project configurations and define development interfaces.
* Main Game Structure:
    * Design the main game class structure and architectural framework.
2. User Interface and Background Implementation
* UI & Background Creation:
    * Develop the initial background and overall UI according to the wireframes.
3. Core Game Flow and Mechanics
* Game Flow Methods:
    * Implement methods to manage game progression and state transitions.
* Game State Management:
    * Create logic for real-time updates, collision detection, and state management.
* Interaction Logging:
    * Outline how the game logs interactions for analysis and feedback.
* Scoring and Feedback:
    * Integrate scoring systems and provide visual feedback mechanisms.
4. Final Implementation Details
* Final Adjustments:
    * Detail the final implementation aspects for all integrated systems and polish the overall experience.
